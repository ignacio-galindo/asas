"""Emitter seam + routing policy + dispatcher (WXL-222).

- Producers ``register_kind`` at wiring time (defaults: category/urgency/reason) and
  call ``notify`` inside their own transaction — the insert IS the enqueue.
- The routing policy maps urgency to external channels: ``low`` is in-app only
  (ambient activity never emails you — the epic's KPI), ``normal``/``high`` get an
  email delivery row. ``in_app`` is intrinsic: the notification row itself.
- The dispatcher is queue-shaped but v1-simple: an after-commit hook plus a
  startup/periodic sweep (same self-heal pattern as ``search/semantic.py``), core
  SQL only (an ORM session inside ``after_commit`` would re-fire the hook). Send
  failures never fail the producing transaction; a real worker can replace this
  later with zero schema change.

    """Send pending deliveries through their channel adapters. Returns the number
    of rows that reached a terminal-or-retried state this pass. Failed sends stay
    retryable until ``MAX_ATTEMPTS``; a missing adapter or ``SkipDelivery`` marks
    the row skipped.

    Duplicate-safe under concurrent passes (TEAMY-475): each row is claimed with
    a rows-affected CAS UPDATE (pending → sending) committed *before* the adapter
    send, so an overlapping pass — the after-commit hook racing the 60s job, or a
    second app instance — loses the CAS and skips the row instead of re-sending
    it. The send itself runs outside any transaction; the outcome commits in a
    short follow-up transaction. Claims left by a crashed process reclaim to
    pending after ``STALE_CLAIM_SECONDS``. The overall contract stays
    at-least-once (a crash between send and mark re-sends that one row) — same
    as the jobs queue."""
