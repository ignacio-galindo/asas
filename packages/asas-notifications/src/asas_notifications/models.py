"""Notification rows + the per-channel delivery outbox (WXL-222).

``notification`` IS the in-app delivery (insert = enqueue, read_at = seen);
``notification_delivery`` exists only for external channels (email now, Slack/Teams
later) — one row per (notification, channel) the routing policy selects at emit
time. Enums are plain VARCHARs (``native_enum=False``, dual-engine rule).

``org_id`` follows the tenancy epic's mapping (WXL-218): notifications are tenant
data — org-scoped in the catalog, stamped from the producing request's context.
