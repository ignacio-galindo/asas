"""Typed errors. Everything the library raises derives from :class:`GraphError`.

Three layers, so a host can catch at the altitude it cares about:

- :class:`GraphConfigError` — the host wired the library wrong. Raised at
  construction time, never mid-request.
- :class:`GraphAuthError` / :class:`GraphRequestError` — the transport: a
  token could not be acquired, or Graph answered a request with 4xx/5xx.
  ``GraphRequestError`` carries the parsed Graph error envelope (``code``,
  ``message``, ``request_id``) and ``retry_after`` when Graph throttled.
- :class:`MeetingError` and its three subclasses — the Teams-meeting service
  failed at one specific operation. The transport error is chained as
  ``__cause__`` so nothing is lost by catching the higher one.

The library never maps these to HTTP status codes; how a *host* reports a
Graph failure to *its* callers is host policy.
