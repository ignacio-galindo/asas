# ── Filename flattening for storage keys ────────────────────────────────────
#
# What the backends actually accept (checked 2026-09-28):
#
# - Amazon S3: a key is any UTF-8 sequence up to 1,024 BYTES, prefix and
#   delimiters included. "Safe" is ASCII alphanumerics plus ! - _ . * ' ( );
#   & $ @ = ; / : + , ? space and ASCII 0x00-0x1F / 0x7F "might require special
#   handling"; \ { } ^ % ` [ ] " < > ~ # | and 0x80-0xFF are "to avoid"; "." and
#   ".." segments misbehave in tools; CR/LF need XML entities in list/delete
#   bodies. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html
# - Azure Blob: 1 to 1,024 CHARACTERS (the emulator: 256); control characters
#   0x00-0x1F and C1 (U+0080...) are not allowed; noncharacters such as U+FDD0-
#   U+FDEF, U+FFFE/U+FFFF and U+xFFFE/U+xFFFF, plus U+FFF0-U+FFFD, "may fail
#   UTF-8 or MBCS decoding"; private-use code points like U+E000 "cannot be
#   used"; no name or path segment should end with ".", "/" or "\".
#   https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/naming-and-referencing-containers--blobs--and-metadata
# - Supabase Storage (an S3Storage target): isValidKey is
#   /^[A-Za-z0-9_/!.*'() &$=@;:+,?-]*$/, so it rejects EVERY non-ASCII key.
#   That, not U+202F specifically, is why the TEAMY-248 cutover saw 400s.
#   https://github.com/supabase/storage/blob/master/src/storage/limits.ts
#   That is why ASCII stays the DEFAULT (ascii_only=True): a live host is on
#   Supabase, and a Unicode default would turn its accented and Arabic uploads
#   into 400s that no local-storage test would catch. Hosts on AWS S3, Azure
#   Blob or LocalStorage opt in with ascii_only=False.
# - LocalStorage: one key segment is one file name, and NAME_MAX is 255 bytes
#   on ext4/XFS/APFS. put() writes ``.<segment>.<32 hex>.tmp`` first (38 more
#   bytes), and hosts compose ``<uuid>-<safe_filename>`` (37 more), leaving
#   180 bytes for the filename; the cap below keeps 20 bytes of that spare.
#
# So a kept character must be a letter, digit, or a combining mark attached to
# one (every category the stores reject or treat specially is outside that),
# plus the ASCII punctuation both S3 lists as safe or special and the old rule
# already shipped. Everything else becomes "_".

    **Two charsets.** By default (``ascii_only=True``) only ASCII
    ``[A-Za-z0-9 ._()-]`` survives, which every backend accepts, Supabase
    Storage included. With ``ascii_only=False`` the rule below keeps letters in
    any script, so an Arabic name stays readable; use it on AWS S3, Azure Blob
    and ``LocalStorage``, never on Supabase, whose key validator rejects any
    non-ASCII character.

    The name is normalized to NFC first, so one visual name gives one key.
    With ``ascii_only=False``, kept: Unicode letters and digits (``str.isalnum()``), combining marks that
    follow one (Arabic harakat, Indic vowel signs), and the ASCII characters
    ``space . _ ( ) -``. Every other character becomes ``_``: all whitespace
    except a plain space (U+202F, U+00A0, tabs, line and paragraph
    separators), control characters, format characters (Cf, which includes
    the bidi marks, embeddings, overrides and isolates such as U+200F and
    U+202E, so ``invoice<U+202E>fdp.exe`` cannot display as ``invoiceexe.pdf``),
    path separators, symbols and emoji, private-use code points,
    noncharacters, and default-ignorable letters. Leading spaces and trailing
    spaces or dots are trimmed (Azure: no segment should end with a dot).

    The result is at most ``max_bytes`` UTF-8 bytes; a longer name loses the
    end of its stem, never its extension. It is never empty, ``.`` or ``..``
    (``file`` stands in) and never contains ``/``.

    NFC, the trim and the byte cap apply in both modes.

    Only the *key* is flattened; the display name stored on the row keeps the
    original. Uploaders prefix keys with a uuid, so flattening can't collide.
