# asas-sync

Keep a local copy of a remote paginated collection (an ERP's requisitions, an
HRIS's workers, a CRM's accounts) up to date incrementally, so you can list,
search and join it without calling the remote every time, and trust that the
copy is complete.

```python
import asas_sync

class Workers:  # your adapter over the remote API
    async def fetch(self, *, since, after_key, offset, limit, purpose):
        body = await http.get("/workers", params=...)  # stamp >= since, key > after_key, ordered by key
        return asas_sync.RemotePage(rows=body["items"], has_more=body["hasMore"])

    async def exists(self, key):
        response = await http.get(f"/workers/{key}")
        return {200: True, 404: False}.get(response.status_code)  # None: cannot say

spec = asas_sync.SyncSpec(
    resource="workers", collection=Workers(),
    key=lambda r: r["PersonId"], stamp=lambda r: parse(r["LastUpdateDate"]),
    upsert=upsert_workers, on_deleted=mark_workers_deleted,
    key_ordered=True, page_size=500, offset_ceiling=10_000,
)

asas_sync.migrate(engine)                                   # boot
await asas_sync.run_pass(session_factory, spec, org_id=org)  # on a schedule or an event
await asas_sync.reconcile(session_factory, spec, org_id=org) # weekly
```

## What it gets right, so you do not have to

- **Unstable tie order loses rows under offset paging.** Many APIs return
  rows that share a timestamp in a different order on each request, so paging
  by offset across such a block skips some and repeats others. A key-ordered
  walk re-anchors on the last key with offset 0; a stamp-ordered one re-anchors
  on the page's greatest stamp with offset 0 and uses an offset only inside a
  block longer than a page.
- **"No more rows" is a lie at the offset ceiling.** Some APIs stop at a fixed
  offset and say `has_more=False` there with rows left. `offset_ceiling` turns
  that into a re-anchor.
- **The watermark never passes the walk's own start** (less `clock_skew_s`)
  nor the greatest stamp actually read, so a row modified while the walk ran is
  read by the next pass instead of being lost for good.
- **Deletion takes two misses.** A key is deleted only when two consecutive
  complete reconcile walks missed it. The first reconcile only lays a baseline,
  and an incomplete walk deletes nothing. Where the walk is not exact
  (stamp-ordered), a twice-missed key is read by key, and only an explicit
  "gone" deletes it.
- **Capped passes resume.** `max_pages` bounds one pass; the next continues
  after the last committed key instead of starting over.
- **One pass per collection at a time,** by a compare-and-set lease on the
  cursor row that is renewed per page and expires if the holder dies. Portable
  to SQLite and Postgres; no advisory lock.
- **Each page commits on its own,** so a failure stops the walk with the cursor
  at the last committed page, and the error is recorded on the cursor.
- **Followers refresh what changed.** `PassResult.changed_keys` names the keys
  met with a stamp after the pass's starting watermark, so the work that
  follows a pass (re-reading the records the mirror feeds) touches only those.
  `None` means "everything": a walk from nothing, a full walk, more than
  `changed_keys_cap` (2,000), or a pass that RESUMED a stopped walk, whose
  earlier pages were never reported. The row at the watermark is re-read on
  every pass and is not a change.
- **A record a notification names is read by key.** `refresh_keys(...)` asks
  the collection's optional `fetch_keys(keys)` and upserts what comes back: no
  walk, no lease, the watermark untouched. It may race a pass, which is safe
  only because the upsert never goes backwards.
- **The upsert never goes backwards.** `upsert_newer(session, table, rows,
  key_columns=..., stamp_column=...)` is `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE ...
  WHERE stamp <= new stamp`, so a page read a moment ago cannot overwrite the
  version a notification just read. Equal stamps still rewrite, so a full walk
  refills every column.
- **A waiting pass holds no connection.** `wait_s=` retries the lease between
  short transactions, for a pass that must not be dropped (one a notification
  triggered); without it a held lease is `SyncBusyError` at once.
- **A copy saved beside the mirror is served only while the mirror vouches for
  it.** `saved_copy_is_current(cursor, saved_stamp=..., mirrored_stamp=...)` is
  True only when the collection was walked to the end, its last pass completed
  without an error, and the copy's stamp is at least the mirror's.

## Host contract

Table-owning, router-less, no seed.

- `migrate(engine)`: package Alembic chain (`alembic_version_asas_sync`).
- `run_pass(session_factory, spec, org_id=..., full=False, wait_s=0,
  retry_s=15)` and `reconcile(session_factory, spec, org_id=..., wait_s=0)`:
  async. The remote call is async; the database work runs in short sync
  transactions off the event loop.
- `refresh_keys(session_factory, spec, keys, org_id=...)`: records by key
  (needs the collection's `fetch_keys`).
- `upsert_newer(...)` and `saved_copy_is_current(...)`: see above.
- `cursor_status(session, spec, org_id=...)`: the cursor, for an admin card.

Your `upsert` must be idempotent: rows at a re-anchor are read twice, and a
pass that failed after a commit repeats a page. If you use `refresh_keys`, it
must also never replace a newer row with an older one (`upsert_newer`).
